# Organize-Your-Life-With-Note-Taker

## Description

This project allows the user to quickly add or delete a note/reminder and store the notes in a database so they will remain until deleted.  During this project, I learned about routes, servers, and deploying a project to Heroku.

## Usage

Link to deployed page:

This is an easy to use note taking app.  To add a note, simply type in a title, type in a body message, then hit the 'save' icon in the top right corner.  To delete a note, find the note you want to delete on the list of notes and click the 'trash can' to delete.

## Credits

1. I used examples in our class mini project to begin the project. 

2. I watched the video "Node Express Tutorial 5 - Making a DELETE request" on the Brett M youtube channel to get part of my method of creating a delete request, specifically how to get the notes_id to equal req.params.  Here is a link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9jTQPb0Xso  

3. I got the idea to use filter() to delete my item from a Stack Overflow page titled, "Express.js delete request" made by user Syscall.  Here is a link to the page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61526572/express-js-delete-request

4. This project came with starter code which can be found in the public folder.
